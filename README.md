# DJANGO ECOMMERCE WEBSITE 

It is a fully functional website for online sales. 

It was written in Django and uses the Django Rest Framework.

It has many functionalities such as: writing product reviews, adding to the basket,
payments via PayPal, writing messages, creating user accounts and many others. 
All functions are included in the documentation.

The most difficult part of the project was adding the payment gateway.
Payments work fine but are not perfect. In future updates they will be improved to be more efficient
